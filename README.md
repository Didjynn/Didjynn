- 👋 Hi, I’m @Didjynn
- 👀 I’m interested in game design, animation, video games, insects, science, archeology... and so much more !
- 🌱 I’m currently learning gamemaker programming language. I began 4 years ago.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video games projects. But I'm too serious about work so people are scared to work with me.
- 📫 How to reach me : chalard.jeremy@gmail.com
